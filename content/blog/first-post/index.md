  to go? I can not give you the answers to these questions. What I can do is
  tell you what worked for me and what did not.

My paternal grandfather, uncle, and father all had (had because my grandfather is no more) one thing in common: their artistry.

My grandfather was a sculptor, while both my father and uncle are great at drawing and painting. Despite neither one of them making a career out of their artistry, they managed to cultivate it as amateurs just fine. 

Imagine, then, my father's disappointment when he tried to get me to join the family tradition, just to fail miserably.

## Fundamentals of Design

I was a dumb kid. Even worse, I was bull-headed. Drawing, chess, sculpting, nothing measured up to my passion for gaming. In my late twenties, things have not changed much. I still long to lose myself in a video game more than ever.

But the ever-growing overlap between technology and art managed to succeed where my father failed: develop an artistic bone in my body.

In my quest to make my websites look less trashy, I developed a fond appreciation for the design fundamentals: contrast, negative space, alignment, visual hierarchy.

I do not think my father even knows these fundamentals exist. But I am confident he never failed to apply them in any of his sketches and drawings. Beautiful irony!

Why did I get into design now but could not bother with it during my childhood? Is it too late for me to become a graphics designer at my current age?

## Headstarts Matter?

There is a theory called the 10,000-hour rule popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his bestseller Outliers: The Story of Success. The premise is simple: you focus on learning a single skill long enough (say, 10,000-hours), and you can master it. It is that simple!

Guess I am a pro-Warframe player. Ha!

Jokes aside, I am sure you can poke a few holes in this theory even if you are not an "expert." For one, this theory is trying to simplify a phenomenon as abstract as the human brain: how humans learn.

"Assuming all things remain constant" is a phrase that belongs in scientific papers and physics textbooks. Everywhere else, it is useless!

To assume every human being applies the same level of focus during all those fated 10,000 hours of bull-headed skill acquisition is wishful thinking.

Safe to say, headstarts or no, your mastery level in a skill is not directly proportional to the number of hours you pour into it.

So what is it proportional to?

How am I supposed to know?! I am a 27-year old intern, for God's sake!

## A Toast to the Amateurs

Even if there is no hope for me to achieve the level of success graphics designers such as Herb Lubalin did, I have decided to keep going.

Even if there is no hope for me to get hired as a UI designer or web developer, I have decided to keep going.

Even if I do not make any money from these skills I am working so hard to learn, I have decided to keep going.

Because I think I get it. It is not about the result—that once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity—it is about the process.

If I get to cultivate my artistry as an amateur rather than as a professional—a so-called master—I would stay an amateur all my life. As my father, and his father before him, did.

A toast to all the amateurs in my life, I guess.
